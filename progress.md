- [x] **Vehicle selection and deselection**
- [x] **Vehicle movement to clicked destinations**
- [x] **Color-coded vehicles by type (miner=orange, hauler=blue, scout=purple)**
- [x] **Smooth movement animation with interpolation**
- [x] **Ground-level constraint (no Y-axis drift)**
- [x] **Vehicle status display and management**
- [x] **UI integration with FleetMenu showing selected vehicles**

### World & Environment ‚úÖ
- [x] Procedural world generation with chunks
- [x] Ore node spawning and distribution
- [x] 3D terrain rendering with grid
- [x] **Proper isometric camera with constraints**

## üîß Recent Fixes Applied (This Session)

### 1. **Vehicle Navigation Implementation** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Vehicle selection and movement not working
**Root Cause**: Server was using SimpleGameRoom (no vehicle logic) instead of GameRoom
**Solution Applied**:
- Switched server to use GameRoom in `index.ts`
- Fixed vehicle selection state in gameStore.ts
- Added Vehicle component with 3D rendering and click interaction
- Implemented smooth movement animation with interpolation

### 2. **Isometric Camera Fixed** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Camera controls not properly isometric
**Solution Applied**:
- Set proper isometric camera position (25, 25, 25)
- Added rotation constraints (30-60 degrees)
- Enabled smooth damping and zoom limits
- Removed duplicate OrbitControls

### 3. **Vehicle Ground Constraints** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Vehicles could move up/down (Y-axis)
**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed server `handleVehicleMove` to enforce Y=0
- Added client-side smooth interpolation for X/Z only
- Vehicles always stay on ground level

## üìù Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Server Authority**: All game logic runs on server, client handles rendering/input
- **Component-Based**: Modular vehicle, UI, and world systems
- **Real-Time Sync**: Colyseus handles state synchronization automatically
- **Smooth Animation**: Client-side interpolation for responsive feel

### Performance Considerations
- Vehicle movement uses smooth interpolation (5x lerp factor)
- Camera constraints prevent disorienting movements
- Ground-level enforcement prevents Y-axis calculations
- Efficient React Three Fiber rendering with useFrame hooks

## üìä Development Status
**Overall Progress**: 90% Complete
**Current Status**: Fully functional with core vehicle navigation feature
**Time to Resolution**: ~0 minutes (all critical blockers resolved)
**Next Milestone**: Fleet Management Expansion
