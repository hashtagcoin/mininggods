### **1. Game Summary & Vision**

Mining Gods is an isometric, fleet-management strategy game set in a vast, procedurally generated world. Players command an expanding fleet of autonomous vehicles to build a mining empire. The core experience blends logistical optimization, deep modular customization, and a high-stakes economy with a real-world Web3 integration.

The initial product is a **rich single-player experience** where the player competes against sophisticated AI fleets. The entire architecture is **designed from the ground up as multiplayer-ready**, utilizing a simulated client-server model to ensure a seamless future transition to a persistent, shared-world online game where players compete and cooperate in different risk zones.

### **2. Core Gameplay Pillars**

*   **Command an Autonomous Fleet:** Progress from a single rig to a massive, automated operation. Deploy specialized vehicles (Miners, Transporters, etc.) and design efficient supply chains to maximize your mining empire's output.
*   **Navigate a High-Stakes Economy:** Manage a critical fuel supply that creates constant economic pressure. Make strategic decisions on converting standard ore to in-game currency for upgrades or withdrawing rare "Crypto Ore" to a personal crypto wallet.
*   **Deep Modular Customization:** Every vehicle is a collection of swappable parts. Use a visual "Garage" interface to balance speed, fuel efficiency, cargo capacity, and other stats to optimize your fleet for any task.
*   **Explore a Living World:** The near-infinite, procedurally generated map is filled with opportunity. Discover rich ore deposits, scavenge for powerful abandoned parts, and navigate different risk zones for greater rewards.

### **3. Target Audience & Platforms**

*   **Players:** 16-40 yrs, fans of simulation (Factorio), tycoon (Transport Tycoon), light RTS, MMO-lite (Albion Online), and crypto/Web3-enabled games.
*   **MVP Platform:** Desktop Web (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) - Built with React.js
*   **Mobile Platform:** iOS & Android - React Native with Expo 53 (converted from React.js codebase for maximum code reuse)
*   **Future Platforms:** Progressive Web App (PWA) support for mobile browsers

### **4. Detailed Feature Breakdown**

#### **4.1. World & Generation**
*   **Procedural Generation:** The world is generated using a layered **Perlin Noise** strategy for near-infinite scale and variety.
    *   **Layer 1 (Heightmap):** Determines large-scale terrain (mountains, plains, valleys).
    *   **Layer 2 (Biome/Mineral Maps):** Determines biome types (e.g., rocky, icy) and the location of ore deposits (Iron, Copper, Crypto Nodes).
    *   **Layer 3 (Clutter Map):** Determines placement of non-interactive rocks and debris for visual richness.
*   **Chunk-Based Loading:** The world is loaded and rendered in "chunks" around the player's active camera view to ensure high performance and low memory usage.
*   **Zone System (For future multiplayer):** The map is logically divided into zones:
    *   **Zone 1 (Safe):** For new players. No PvP combat. Contains basic ores.
    *   **Zone 2 (Contested):** Higher-value ores. PvP combat is enabled.
    *   **Zone 3 (High-Risk):** Ultra-rare Crypto Nodes and legendary parts. Ruthless PvP and environmental hazards.

#### **4.2. Fleet Management & Vehicles**
*   **Fleet Control:** Players manage a fleet of vehicles up to their current **Hangar Capacity**, which can be upgraded.
*   **Fleet UI:** A horizontally scrolling menu at the bottom of the screen displays all owned vehicles. Each vehicle is a card showing its custom name and skin/icon. Tapping a card selects that vehicle and opens its detailed configuration panel.
*   **Vehicle Classes:**
    *   **Miner (MVP):** Extracts ore from nodes. The backbone of the operation.
    *   **Transporter (MVP):** Automates ore transport from Miners to the base.
    *   **Scout (Post-MVP):** A very fast exploration unit with an advanced, long-range scanner.
    *   **Armoury (Post-MVP):** A dedicated defensive/offensive combat unit.

#### **4.3. Core Gameplay Loops**
*   **Automation:** The primary loop involves assigning Transporters to Miners to create automated income streams, freeing the player for strategic tasks.
*   **Fuel & Refueling:**
    *   All vehicles consume fuel when moving. Fuel is a critical resource purchased with **BASH Coin**.
    *   To refuel the fleet, the player summons an **autonomous AI "Tanker"** for a flat BASH Coin fee. The Tanker travels to and refuels all of the player's vehicles in the field.
*   **Scavenging:** Players can find abandoned, high-tier vehicle parts in the world. They can swap parts on the fly, dropping their old part, which then becomes a salvageable item for others (including AI).
*   **Progression:** The main progression path involves earning currency to:
    1.  Expand the fleet by purchasing new vehicles.
    2.  Upgrade the main **Hangar** at the base to increase maximum fleet capacity.
    3.  Upgrade individual vehicle components (engines, cargo bays, etc.) in the **Garage**.

#### **4.4. Economy & Monetization**
*   **Currencies:**
    *   **Credits (Soft Currency):** Earned from selling standard ore. Used for most vehicle upgrades.
    *   **BASH Coin (Premium Currency):** Earned by converting rare "Crypto Ore" or purchased directly with real money. Required for buying **Fuel** and premium items.
*   **Market Saturation:** The sell price of standard ore dynamically decreases in a zone as more of it is sold, encouraging resource diversification and exploration.
*   **Web3 Integration (Crypto Withdrawal):**
    *   Players can mine rare Crypto Nodes (e.g., BTC Ore, ETH Ore).
    *   At the base, they can choose to convert this ore to BASH Coin or withdraw it to a personal crypto wallet as real cryptocurrency.
    *   A **1% processing fee** is applied to all crypto withdrawals.

### **5. User Experience (UX) & Controls**
*   **View:** Isometric, top-down camera.
*   **Control Scheme:**
    *   **Direct Control:** WASD / On-screen joystick for manually controlling a single selected vehicle.
    *   **RTS Control:** Left-click/drag to select units; right-click to issue move, mine, or assign commands.
*   **The Garage:** A clean, visual, 2D interface showing a vehicle schematic with clickable component slots (`Power Plant`, `Fuel Tank`, `Cargo Bay`, `Scanner`) for easy, modular part-swapping.

### **6. Technical Architecture (Multiplayer-Ready)**

The MVP will be built on a **simulated client-server architecture**. For the single-player MVP, the "server" runs as a local process alongside the client. This ensures all game logic is properly separated for a future transition to a live, networked environment.

| Layer | Implementation | Tasklist Keywords for Development |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Server** | **Node.js** with **Colyseus** or **Nakama** | `Setup Colyseus Server`, `Define Room State Schema`, `Implement Player Auth Stub`, `Implement RPC Handlers` |
| **Client** | **React.js** with **Vite** | `Setup Vite Project`, `Component Library (ChakraUI/MUI)`, `UI State Hooks (Zustand)`, `API Service Layer` |
| **Rendering** | **React Three Fiber (R3F)** | `Setup R3F Scene`, `Implement Camera Controls`, `Define Lighting`, `Post-Processing Stack`, `InstancedMesh Manager for Vehicles & Clutter` |
| **Physics** | **Rapier (headless on Server)** | `Setup Server Physics World`, `Generate Terrain Mesh Collider from Noise`, `Create Vehicle RigidBody`, `Implement Raycasting for Terrain Following` |
| **State Sync** | **WebSockets (via Colyseus/Nakama)** | `Integrate Colyseus Client SDK`, `Implement State Listener`, `Define Client Input Schema`, `Send Inputs to Server on Tick` |
| **State Mgmt.** | **Zustand (Client)** | `Create UI Store for Menus`, `Create Server State Mirror Store` |
| **World Gen.** | **`noisejs` library (Server)** | `Perlin Seed Manager`, `Heightmap Generator`, `Biome Map Generator`, `On-the-fly Chunk Generation Logic` |
| **Persistence**| **Persistence Adapter Layer (Server)** | `Define IPersistenceAdapter Interface`, **`Create LocalStorageAdapter (MVP)`**, `Create SupabaseAdapter (Future)` |
| **Web3** | **`ethers.js` (Client)** | `Implement Wallet Connection UI (ConnectKit/RainbowKit)`, `Read Contract Data`, `Initiate Withdrawal Transaction` |

#### **6.1. Data Persistence Strategy**
To ensure a seamless transition from local development to a cloud-based production database, all server-side data persistence will be handled through an **abstracted adapter**.

1.  **Define Interface (`IPersistenceAdapter`):** Create a common interface with methods like `saveGameState(userId, state)` and `loadGameState(userId)`.
2.  **MVP Implementation (`LocalStorageAdapter`):** For the MVP, implement this interface to read/write the game state to a local file or browser LocalStorage.
3.  **Future Implementation (`SupabaseAdapter`):** For production, implement the same interface using the Supabase client library to interact with a PostgreSQL database.
4.  **Integration:** The server will be configured to use the appropriate adapter based on the environment. Switching from local saves to a cloud database will require changing only a single line of code in the server's configuration, not the core game logic.
